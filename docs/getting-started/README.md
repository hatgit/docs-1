# Getting Started

Our JavaScript API library package will be released soon. We're excited to provide you the resources to integrate and build on the OpenLaw protocol.

Check back here for instructions on how to get set up to start building with OpenLaw. In the meantime, you can start getting familiar with the relevant documentation in [REST API](/api-client/) and [Openlaw Object](/openlaw-object/).

You can also check out our [Markup Language documentation](/markup-language/) to start creating your own dynamic legal agreements using OpenLaw.
